# Self-proppelled_particles
A quick Julia implementation of T.Vicsek algorithm for spp

I used this algorithm as an excuse for learning Julia programming language. The simple model developed by Vicsek et al. (Physical Review Letters, Vol.75, Number 6, August 1995) succeded in showing a new type of phase transitions occurring on a system of self driven particles. This model explains to some extent the motion of biological systems involving clustering and migration such as schools of fish, herds of quadrupedes and flocks of birds. On its heart, the model shows the phase transition from a uniform ordered motion of all particles to a cluster-like motion.
